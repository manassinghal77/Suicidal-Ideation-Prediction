# Social Media Prediction using Machine and Deep Learning Techniques
This project aims to identify suicidal ideation on social media using machine and deep learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset of 44,300 posts collected from Reddit and Twitter, manually labeled as either containing suicidal ideation or not. The project uses various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and SVM, as well as a hybrid model of CNN and LSTM for text classification.
# Usage
The Jupyter Notebook contains all the code and explanations for the project. To run the notebook, make sure all the required packages are installed and run the cells in order.

The notebook includes data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and word embedding using GloVe. It also includes code for training and testing various machine learning algorithms and the hybrid CNN-LSTM model. The results and evaluation metrics are also displayed in the notebook.
